## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following {{branch_naming_convention}}
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### DOC_UPDATES

- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md
  
### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS

- Follow the format: type(scope): description for all commit messages
- Use consistent types (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore) across the project
- Define clear scopes based on {{project_modules}} to indicate affected areas
- Include issue references in commit messages to link changes to requirements
- Use breaking change footer (!: or BREAKING CHANGE:) to clearly mark incompatible changes
- Configure commitlint to automatically enforce conventional commit format
