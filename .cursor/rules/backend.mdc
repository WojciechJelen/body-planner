### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend
- Use the best practices of using Supabase with NextJS (15.2), for both `client` and server components.
